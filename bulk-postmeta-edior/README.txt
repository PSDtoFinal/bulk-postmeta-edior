Allows you to bulk-edit post meta information (including custom post types) from a single place.

== Description ==

This easy-to-use plugin allows you to quickly and easily edit post meta values for almost any post type (including custom post types)

Edit post meta as plain text, in textareas, as light-weight HTML or using the full WordPress WYSIWYG editor!

From the first version, this has been designed for ease of use by site Contributors and Editors, but keeps settings reserved for Admin's only. This gives site Adaministrators control over what less-privileged users can bulk edit.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `bulk-postmeta-edior` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Navigate to Bulk Edit => Settings to set up your first edit group
